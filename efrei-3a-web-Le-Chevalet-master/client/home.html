            <h1>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</h1>
            <h2>Pablo Picasso - 1907</h2>
            <p>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is a large-format (243.9 × 233.7 cm1) oil painting on canvas, done in Paris by Pablo Picasso in 1907. The painting is considered to be one of the most important paintings in the history of painting because of the stylistic and conceptual break it proposes [ref. necessary]. According to Henri Matisse, it is probably on the basis of a misunderstanding that from 1907 Les Demoiselles d'Avignon or Bordel d'Avignon is considered to be the first Cubist painting2. Picasso had a greater sense of public relations than Georges Braque, and towards the end of the 1950s, he would end up taking full credit for the authorship of Cubism.</p>

            <h1>Les tournesols</h1>
            <h2>Vincent van Gogh - 1888 </h2>
            <p>Towards the end of the twentieth century, sunflowers were prized in floral compositions and therefore still lifes. Symbolizing a joie de vivre and humanistic idealism, they were appreciated for their strong expressiveness. An artist particularly represented them: Vincent Van Gogh. Painter of the 19th century, he discovered sunflowers during his studies of Flemish Baroque in Antwerp.
              Thus, during the month of August 1888, he painted six paintings of them, which he copied in January. Presented as a series, the artist named the first sunflowers and the last ones, Rehearsals.

            <h1>La Raie verte</h1>
            <h2>Henri Matisse - 1905</h2>
            <p> The painting was exhibited for the first time in 1905 at the Salon d'Automne in Paris. Very little appreciated when it came out, the painting was exhibited in what would eventually be called "la cage aux fauves". This nickname, "fauve", is due to the art critic Louis Vauxcelles, very influential in the early twentieth century. The latter will therefore say "It is Donatello among the Fauvists" and will qualify these paintings as "pots of paint thrown in the face of the public".
              Attempting to discredit Fauvism at the time, he would, however, give it the name we know today.

            <h2>Lee Jong-gu - 2008</h2>
            <p>Lee Jong Gu is an agrarian painter of our generation who has continually painted Korean rural life in its original 
              form for the past twenty years. He is a painter who does not produce paintings that depict farmers and rural landscape romantically. 
              He portrays the immanent anger, struggle as well as hopes that many farmers harbor with a critical sense of realism. The artist’s father who was a farmer, 
              often becomes his chief motif and in order to efficiently embrace his father’s life, he uses rice sacks as his canvas.</p>
